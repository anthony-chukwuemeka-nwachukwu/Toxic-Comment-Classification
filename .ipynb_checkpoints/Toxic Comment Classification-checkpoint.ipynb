    "Two challenges you might face while trying to download this data are:\n",
    "- Pulling the data from Kaggle directly to the notebook instance you might be working with\n",
    "- Memory issue if you are using Amazon SagemMaker\n",
    "I have tried to address these issues below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install Kaggle library and downlaod Zip file\n",
    "To successfully pull the data directly to your notebook incase you are working on a remote device, you can take these steps:\n",
    "1. **pip install the Kaggle library**. You can do this by opening the notebook's terminal and running, `pip install the Kaggle library`\n",
    "2. **Create a directory** to put the API token in, so the Kaggle library will know where to look for your sign-in credentials when you try to access the API from your notebook. This directory must be named `.kaggle` and it must be in the same directory as your installation of Python, which is typically the home directory. Note that this file will be hidden. Do this on the terminal. `mkdir .kaggle`\n",
    "3. **Go to your Kaggle account** (or create one if you haven’t yet), click the profile icon in the top right corner of the screen, and select “my profile” from the dropdown list. Scroll down to about middle of the page, and click on “Create a New API Token”. Then, a file named kaggle.json will automatically download to your downloads folder (or your default download folder). This file contains your sign-in credentials to allow you to access the API.\n",
    "4. **Navigate to the directory** where the above file was downlaoded, you need to move the kaggle.json file to the new .kaggle directory. Do this on the terminal. `mv kaggle.json path_to_the_.kaggle_folder/.kaggle`\n",
    "5. **Now you can view list of kaggle competions** from your terminal. `kaggle competitions list`\n",
    "6. **You can down the competition zip folder** through your terminal directly to the location you are working at. `kaggle competitions download -c jigsaw-multilingual-toxic-comment-classification`. If you want to do the download from the notebook, `!kaggle competitions download -c jigsaw-multilingual-toxic-comment-classification`\n",
    "\n",
    "> I also recommend you go through this github link `https://github.com/floydwch/kaggle-cli`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unzip the file\n",
    "One major challenged I faced while trying to unzip the file on Amazon SageMaker was memory issue. This was how I resolved that.\n",
    "1. **I went to Amazon SageMaker**, then to the Notebook Instance I was working on. I clicked on `edit`, then scrolled down to the `volume`. I increased the default volume from 5gb to like 160gb. Then updated. That solved the issue for me.\n",
    "2. **Then I proceeded** to the next cell below."

    "The code for this can be found inside the helper function  \n",
    "> **Note** that translating could be a bit difficult. In my case, I used google API. The keep blocking it, I deviced a walkaround whereby when you send in the file for translation, it checks the column with the tittle `outcome`. If the value for that row is `success`, it does nothing to it, else (if it is `failure`, which is the default value), it attempts to translate it. If the API has block, it returns that row values as they are, else, it returns the row values with the content (or context) translated."

    "\n",
    "Now that we have trained our model, we would like to test it to see how it performs. Currently our model takes input of the form `review_length, review[500]` where `review[500]` is a sequence of `500` integers which describe the words present in the review, encoded using `word_dict`. Fortunately for us, SageMaker provides built-in inference code for models with simple inputs such as this.\n",

    "There is one thing that we need to provide, however, and that is a function which loads the saved model. This function must be called `model_fn()` and takes as its only parameter a path to the directory where the model artifacts are stored. This function must also be present in the python file which we specified as the entry point. In our case the model loading function has been provided and so no changes need to be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: When the built-in inference code is run it must import the `model_fn()` method from the `train.py` file. This is why the training code is wrapped in a main guard ( ie, `if __name__ == '__main__':` )\n",

What if we wanted to create a web app which accessed our model? The way things are set up currently makes that not possible since in order to access a SageMaker endpoint the app would first have to authenticate with AWS using an IAM role which included access to SageMaker endpoints.
